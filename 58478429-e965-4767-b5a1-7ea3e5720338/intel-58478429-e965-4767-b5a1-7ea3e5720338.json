The root cause of the outage was due to an overwhelming amount of spam traffic across leader nodes, combined with suboptimal handling of high traffic in the pre-released binary v4.3.2. Both these factors contributed to a cascade of network and block synchronization issues.\n\nThe outage occurred in three separate incidents over the 19 hour period. The first synchronization issue occurred at 2:22 PM PST Jan. 12, resulting in all RPC nodes on shard-0 becoming stuck. This was fixed approximately 11 hours later, however, the same issue occurred twice more, once at 7:00 AM PST on Jan. 13, and again at 6:50 PM PST the same day. The issue was ultimately resolved at 1:00 PM PST on Jan. 14. The solution involved rolling back the pre-released binary 4.3.2 on all validator nodes and a number of other fixes including the tuning of libp2p configuration.\n\nThe Harmony team has outlined an action plan for moving forward in a \"Post Outage Response Plan\" available [here](https://harmonyone.notion.site/Post-Outage-Response-Plan-61cba481d0e442d4a28414e5a3f8af84).\n\n\n\n"},{"importance":"Medium","subCategory":"Core Client Release","status":"Completed","eventDate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","updateDate":"2022-01-19T19:46:12.005Z","eventName":"Hyperledger Besu v21.10 Series","details":"The Hyperledger team released Besu [v21.10.0](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/releases/tag/21.10.0) on Nov. 1. 2021.

This would include an extensible base module for extensions, including collectibles, custody, provenance, and marketplaces. \n- __Tendermint v0.35__\n- __Interchain Accounts__ that allows users to manage accounts across multiple blockchains, provides locking and unlocking mechanisms across IBC-enabled blockchains, and adds support for custody providers to service any IBC connected blockchain through a standard interface on the Hub.\n- __Liquid Staking__ which frees secure and low-risk delegations for use in other parts of the Cosmos ecosystem. Liquid staking would also enable the transfer of rewards and voting rights.\n\nThere are various pending items still in discussion for inclusion in the upgrade. Among them are a governance permissioned CosmWASM instance on the hub, upgrades to the Gravity Bridge, and the introduction of budget and farming modules.

These upgrades use existing mechanisms to roll out patches with little downtime for end-users rapidly. \n\nThe Network Nervous System, a canister smart contract-based registry, holds configuration information in a key-value store where each mutation is classified with a new version in the registry. Protocol level upgrades must be upgraded at the same block height to avoid a chain split or other consensus-related issues. A catchup package (CUP) contains all relevant information required for consensus to resume after nodes transition to different versions. To avoid incompatibilities between nodes within the same subnet running different ICP versions, Dfinity proposes that CUPs be fetched from peers over a separate communication channel using an endpoint dedicated to exchanging CUPs. This allows the logic for exchanging CUPs to remain relatively simple and makes both forward and backward compatibility straightforward. \n\nA detailed view of the proposed protocol upgrade improvements can be found at the Dfinity team's official blog post [here](https://medium.com/dfinity/upgrading-the-internet-computer-protocol-45bf6424b268).

This led to erroneous liquidations for 239 users for a total of ~690727.49 bLUNA (~37.249M at the time of writing). Afterwards, a handful of smaller liquidations occurred due to additional price discrepancies. The Anchor team has decided to reimburse affected users in the following amounts:\n- bLUNA repay = 37,249,938.26\n- bETH repay = 359,251.19\n- Total repay = $37,609,189.45\n- Total reimbursement = Total value liquidated - Sold off liquidation = $46,247,494.37 - $37,609,189.45 = $8,638,304.92\n\nWhen accounting for the additional smaller liquidations it is estimated the total will be close to $9M. The team will be migrating the Anchor Oracle Price Feeder, to be replaced with Chainlink's oracle network + the Anchor Hub Contract to avoid similar incidents in the future.\n\n","date":" 9/12/2021 25/12/2021","assets":"anchor-protocol","category":"Performance","objectID":"38bbf568-5ec3-498d-8127-df6c14b9204a","resources":["https://forum.anchorprotocol.com/t/anchor-oracle-price-discrepancy-on-december-9th/1714","https://app.anchorprotocol.com/poll/10"],"update":"This proposal has been rejected."},{"importance":"Low","subCategory":"Contract Deployment","status":"Completed","eventDate":"2021-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","updateDate":"2021-12-24T18:45:17.011Z","eventName":"Limit Orders Multi-Chain Support","details":"0x Limit Orders are now available on Polygon and Binance Smart Chain.

The current PCV implementation will be altered as Fei v2 integrates with Balancer v2 investment pools to provide additional flexibility and configurable inputs for PCV. Lastly, Fei v2 introduces \"protocol equity,\" the amount of excess PCV that would exist if all existing FEI was redeemed for PCV collateral, which will be used to conduct TRIBE buybacks. TRIBE that is repurchased through protocol equity will be allocated to the DAO treasury, staking rewards, or burnt. If the PCV falls below the target reserve ratio in v2, TRIBE will be a mintable asset in exchange for FEI. This is intended to act as a secondary backstop of FEI's peg. \n\nThe v2 launch will be released in phases, with the first phase scheduled to launch in Nov. 2021.

Substrate-based chains can operate independently, but by connecting to Kusama, they rent security from Kusama's validator set and communicate with other bonded parachains. Parachains will launch on Kusama before Polkadot adds support for them.\n\nThe first step in the road to Kusama parachains is in progress with the deployment of the \"Shell\" parachain. KSM stakers voted in favor of [Referendum 110](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/110) to deploy the Shell parachain (an \"empty\" parachain to test the consensus process) on May 17, 2021. Once developers determine that parachain consensus is working properly, the Kusama Council plans to upgrade Shell to \"Statemine\" through a governance motion. If approved, Statemine will become Kusma's first common-good parachain. Kusama will then launch a series of five parachain auctions (each one week apart) that will allow any project attempt to win a parachain slot.
