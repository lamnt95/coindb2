Kiln, the newest merge testnet spec, was also discussed, with two new features expected to be added next week to make the Kiln spec feature complete. Kiln is scheduled to be the last \"dress rehearsal\" before legacy testnets Ropsten, Sepolia, and Goerli are forked into the merge. Rinkeby is expected to be deprecated and not be forked.

This version is recommended for all users, and nodes can be upgraded at their convenience as this is a medium-priority release. This release does include a breaking change, as the Validator Client is incompatible with prior versions of the Beacon Node. The Validator Client and Beacon Node must be on v2.1.0 if the user runs a validator. During testing, the team found that some nodes exhibited a temporary increase in beacon node memory footprint, which returns to normal after the first restart. Due to changes in the database schema, if a user wishes to revert to a previous version of Lighthouse, a re-sync would be required.\n\nThis release includes various optimizations and bug fixes, including adding a mechanism to improve attestation performance during heavy disk I/O, improving cache performance during skip slots and late-blocks, and fixing an issue when peers are excessively penalized and disconnected.

For staking users, upgrading the Beacon Node is considered a medium priority, while upgrading the Validator Client is marked as low priority. For non-staking users, this upgrade is low priority.\n\nThis release improves peer stability and is recommended for any user seeing an erratic peer count or missing attestations due to *InsufficientPeers*.

This version is recommended for all users, and nodes can be upgraded at their convenience as this is a medium-priority release. This release does include a breaking change, as the Validator Client is incompatible with prior versions of the Beacon Node. The Validator Client and Beacon Node must be on v2.1.0 if the user runs a validator. During testing, the team found that some nodes exhibited a temporary increase in beacon node memory footprint, which returns to normal after the first restart. Due to changes in the database schema, if a user wishes to revert to a previous version of Lighthouse, a re-sync would be required.\n\nThis release includes various optimizations and bug fixes, including adding a mechanism to improve attestation performance during heavy disk I/O, improving cache performance during skip slots and late-blocks, and fixing an issue when peers are excessively penalized and disconnected.

If a shard is dominated by two validators with more than 1/3 voting power and they both go down for maintenance, consensus could halt. Additionally, if a large validator dominates a single shard and runs underpowered nodes, block times could be slowed down, which may already be occurring on shard 0.\n\nTo further decentralize the Harmony blockchain, the proposal suggest that a 6.4% max keys per shard limit be imposed to decrease the likelihood of a single shard being taken over by a small group of misbehaving validators.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"status":{"value":"Completed","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"importance":{"value":"Medium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"update":{"value":"This proposal has passed.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}},"date":" 29/11/2021 1/2/2022"},{"eventId":"24bee3d1-ef0d-4078-9548-7195701d2cb9","eventName":"Proposal 134: Development and Marketing Expansion to the Russian Community","assets":"osmosis","secondaryAssets":null,"details":"Osmosis [Proposal 134](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/134) seeks to allocate 7500 OSMO for development and marketing expansion into the Russian-speaking crypto community.

The root cause of the outage was due to an overwhelming amount of spam traffic across leader nodes, combined with suboptimal handling of high traffic in the pre-released binary v4.3.2. Both these factors contributed to a cascade of network and block synchronization issues.\n\nThe outage occurred in three separate incidents over the 19 hour period. The first synchronization issue occurred at 2:22 PM PST Jan. 12, resulting in all RPC nodes on shard-0 becoming stuck. This was fixed approximately 11 hours later, however, the same issue occurred twice more, once at 7:00 AM PST on Jan. 13, and again at 6:50 PM PST the same day. The issue was ultimately resolved at 1:00 PM PST on Jan. 14.

The root cause of the outage was due to an overwhelming amount of spam traffic across leader nodes, combined with suboptimal handling of high traffic in the pre-released binary v4.3.2. Both these factors contributed to a cascade of network and block synchronization issues.\n\nThe outage occurred in three separate incidents over the 19 hour period.

Afterwards, a handful of smaller liquidations occurred due to additional price discrepancies. The Anchor team has decided to reimburse affected users in the following amounts:\n- bLUNA repay = 37,249,938.26\n- bETH repay = 359,251.19\n- Total repay = $37,609,189.45\n- Total reimbursement = Total value liquidated - Sold off liquidation = $46,247,494.37 - $37,609,189.45 = $8,638,304.92\n\nWhen accounting for the additional smaller liquidations it is estimated the total will be close to $9M. The team will be migrating the Anchor Oracle Price Feeder, to be replaced with Chainlink's oracle network + the Anchor Hub Contract to avoid similar incidents in the future.\n\n","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"status":{"value":"Rejected","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"importance":{"value":"Medium","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]},"update":{"value":"This proposal has been rejected.","matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[]}},"date":" 9/12/2021 25/12/2021"},{"eventId":"04e87e62-cc1f-4aa1-bb3c-871882e2c677","eventName":"Limit Orders Multi-Chain Support","assets":"0x","secondaryAssets":["polygon","binance-coin"],"details":"0x Limit Orders are now available on Polygon and Binance Smart Chain.

Fei v2 will replace the existing FEI peg mechanisms by allowing all FEI directly redeemable for Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) reserves, targeting 1:1 redeemability and a 100% reserve ratio. The current PCV implementation will be altered as Fei v2 integrates with Balancer v2 investment pools to provide additional flexibility and configurable inputs for PCV. Lastly, Fei v2 introduces \"protocol equity,\" the amount of excess PCV that would exist if all existing FEI was redeemed for PCV collateral, which will be used to conduct TRIBE buybacks. TRIBE that is repurchased through protocol equity will be allocated to the DAO treasury, staking rewards, or burnt. If the PCV falls below the target reserve ratio in v2, TRIBE will be a mintable asset in exchange for FEI. This is intended to act as a secondary backstop of FEI's peg. \n\nThe v2 launch will be released in phases, with the first phase scheduled to launch in Nov. 2021.

The current PCV implementation will be altered as Fei v2 integrates with Balancer v2 investment pools to provide additional flexibility and configurable inputs for PCV. Lastly, Fei v2 introduces \"protocol equity,\" the amount of excess PCV that would exist if all existing FEI was redeemed for PCV collateral, which will be used to conduct TRIBE buybacks. TRIBE that is repurchased through protocol equity will be allocated to the DAO treasury, staking rewards, or burnt. If the PCV falls below the target reserve ratio in v2, TRIBE will be a mintable asset in exchange for FEI. This is intended to act as a secondary backstop of FEI's peg. \n\nThe v2 launch will be released in phases, with the first phase scheduled to launch in Nov. 2021.
